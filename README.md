Greetings,

I created this script for having much more efficiency on the Diablo III game for PC

As you can see, it's quite simple written, in AHK.
Note: some parts of the script will only work on 

So let's see the scripts made in here:

1. Automatic repair and salvage all normal, magic and rare items at Blacksmith
2. Salvage item with confirmation too on one click
3. Open inventory to GR keys
4. Automatic clicks (for example to send items to stash) and skills 2,3,4
5. Auto Leave Game and rejoin after 6 seconds
